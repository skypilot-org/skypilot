    """Hash the cluster yaml and contents of file mounts to a unique string.

    Two invocations of this function should return the same string if and only
    if the contents of the yaml are the same and the file contents of all the
    file_mounts specified in the yaml are the same.

    Limitations:
    - This function can be expensive if the file mounts are large. (E.g. a few
      seconds for ~1GB.) This should be okay since we expect that the
      file_mounts in the cluster yaml (the wheel and cloud credentials) will be
      small.
    - Symbolic links are not explicitly handled. Some symbolic link changes may
      not be detected.

    Implementation: We create a byte sequence that captures the state of the
    yaml file and all the files in the file mounts, then hash the byte sequence.

    The format of the byte sequence is:
    32 bytes - sha256 hash of the yaml
    for each file mount:
      file mount remote destination (UTF-8), \0
      if the file mount source is a file:
        'file' encoded to UTF-8
        32 byte sha256 hash of the file contents
      if the file mount source is a directory:
        'dir' encoded to UTF-8
        for each directory and subdirectory withinin the file mount (starting from
            the root and descending recursively):
          name of the directory (UTF-8), \0
          name of each subdirectory within the directory (UTF-8) terminated by \0
          \0
          for each file in the directory:
            name of the file (UTF-8), \0
            32 bytes - sha256 hash of the file contents
          \0
      if the file mount source is something else or does not exist, nothing
      \0\0

    Rather than constructing the whole byte sequence, which may be quite large,
    we construct it incrementally by using hash.update() to add new bytes.

    The function will update the cached cluster status in the global state. For
    the design of the cluster status and transition, please refer to the
    sky/design_docs/cluster_status.md

    Args:
        cluster_name: The name of the cluster.
        force_refresh_statuses: if specified, refresh the cluster if it has one
          of the specified statuses. Additionally, clusters satisfying the
          following conditions will be refreshed no matter the argument is
          specified or not:
            - the most latest available status update is more than
              _CLUSTER_STATUS_CACHE_DURATION_SECONDS old, and one of:
                1. the cluster is a spot cluster, or
                2. cluster autostop is set and the cluster is not STOPPED.
        cluster_lock_already_held: Whether the caller is already holding the
          per-cluster lock. You MUST NOT set this to True if the caller does not
          already hold the lock. If True, we will not acquire the lock before
          updating the status. Failing to hold the lock while updating the
          status can lead to correctness issues - e.g. an launch in-progress may
          appear to be DOWN incorrectly. Even if this is set to False, the lock
          may not be acquired if the status does not need to be refreshed.
        cluster_status_lock_timeout: The timeout to acquire the per-cluster
          lock. If timeout, the function will use the cached status. If the
          value is <0, do not timeout (wait for the lock indefinitely). By
          default, this is set to CLUSTER_STATUS_LOCK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS. Warning:
          if correctness is required, you must set this to -1.
        retry_if_missing: Whether to retry the call to the cloud api if the
          cluster is not found when querying the live status on the cloud.

    Returns:
        If the cluster is terminated or does not exist, return None.
        Otherwise returns the cluster record.

    Raises:
        exceptions.ClusterOwnerIdentityMismatchError: if the current user is
          not the same as the user who created the cluster.
        exceptions.CloudUserIdentityError: if we fail to get the current user
          identity.
        exceptions.ClusterStatusFetchingError: the cluster status cannot be
          fetched from the cloud provider or there are leaked nodes causing
          the node number larger than expected.
