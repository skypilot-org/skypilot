        The user "identity" is associated with each SkyPilot cluster they
        creates. This is used in protecting cluster operations, such as
        provision, teardown and status refreshing, in a multi-identity
        scenario, where the same user/device can switch between different
        cloud identities. We check that the user identity matches before:
            - Provisioning/starting a cluster
            - Stopping/tearing down a cluster
            - Refreshing the status of a cluster

        Design choice: we allow the operations that can correctly work with
        a different user identity, as a user should have full control over
        all their clusters (no matter which identity it belongs to), e.g.,
        submitting jobs, viewing logs, auto-stopping, etc.

        The choice of what constitutes an identity is up to each cloud's
        implementation. In general, to suffice for the above purposes,
        ensure that different identities should imply different sets of
        resources are used when the user invoked each cloud's default
        CLI/API.

        The returned identity is a list of strings. The list is in the order of
        strictness, i.e., the first element is the most strict identity, and
        the last element is the least strict identity.
        When performing an identity check between the current active identity
        and the owner identity associated with a cluster, we compare the two
        lists in order: if a position does not match, we go to the next. To
        see an example, see the docstring of the AWS.get_current_user_identity.


        Example identities (see cloud implementations):
            - AWS: [UserId, AccountId]

        """Check if quota is available based on `resources`.

        The _retry_zones function in cloud_vm_ray_backend goes through different
        candidate regions and attempts to provision the requested
        `instance_type` or `accelerator` accelerators in the `region`
        (the `instance_type` or `accelerator`, and `region`, as defined in
        `resources`) until a successful provisioning happens or all regions
        with the requested accelerator have been looked at. Previously,
        SkyPilot would attempt to provision resources in all of these regions.
        However, many regions would have a zero quota or inadequate quota,
        meaning these attempted provisions were destined to fail from
        the get-go.

        Checking the quota is substantially faster than attempting a failed
        provision (~1 second vs 30+ seconds) so this function attempts to
        check the resource quota and return False if it is found to be zero,
        or True otherwise. If False is returned, _retry_zones will not attempt
        a provision in the region, saving time.

        We are only checking for a nonzero quota, instead of also factoring in
        quota utilization because many cloud providers' APIs don't have a
        built-in command for checking the real-time utilization. Checking
        real-time utilization is a more difficult endeavor that involves
        observability etc., so we are holding off on that for now.

        If for at any point the function fails, whether it's because we can't
        import the necessary dependencies or a query using a cloud provider's
        API fails, we will return True, because we cannot conclusively say the
        relevant quota is zero in these cases, and we don't want to
        preemptively exclude regions from an attempted provision if they may
        have an adequate quota.

        Design choice: We chose a just-in-time approach where
        check_quota_available is called immediately before a potential
        attempted provision, rather than checking all region quotas
        beforehand, storing them, and using those values on-demand. This is
        because, for example, _retry_zones may only need to go through one or
        a few regions before a successful region, and running a query to check
        *every* region's quota beforehand would cause an unnecessary delay.

        Returns:
            False if the quota is found to be zero, and true otherwise.
