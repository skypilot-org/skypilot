# Usage Collection
This doc is for sky team only to set up the usage collection service. Instead of using the Grafana's hosted Loki, we host our own Loki service to make sure the data is always available without retention and query limitation. For the message schema, please refer to the [sky/usage/usage_lib.py](sky/usage/usage_lib.py)::UsageMessageToReport.

## Sky Host Loki
To set up the service, following steps should be applied.
### Create a persistent storage for logging
1. Create a S3 bucket for the logging storage (our current bucket: `s3://sky-host-loki` in us-west-2).
2. [Create an IAM role](https://objectivefs.com/howto/how-to-restrict-s3-bucket-policy-to-only-one-aws-s3-bucket) that can only access that bucket using the following policy:
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetBucketLocation",
                "s3:ListAllMyBuckets"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:*",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::sky-host-loki",
                "arn:aws:s3:::sky-host-loki/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
3. Replace the `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` in [loki-s3-config.yaml](sky/usage/loki-s3-config.yaml) with the keys of that IAM role. (For our current keys, please refer to the private doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a0xVfjmIw-g-Jtpux5hXUtVGvNQMbBT-XweLwY2Gvuo/edit#).)

### Launch hosting instance
1. Create a CPU instance for hosting the Loki service: `sky launch --cloud aws --region us-west-2 -c sky-host-loki ''`
2. Change the security group setting of the instance to allow custom TCP inbound 9090.
3. Copy the config file to server `rsync -Pavz sky/usage/loki-s3-config.yaml sky-host-loki:~/loki-config/`
4. Start the loki service with the following command on the server
    ```
    docker run --name loki -d -v ~/loki-config:/mnt/config -p 9090:9090 grafana/loki:2.6.0 -config.file=/mnt/config/loki-s3-config.yaml
    ```

### Connect to Grafana
To visualize the logs collected, we can connect Grafana to our Loki service:
1. click the `Connect data` button in the home page
2. Search for the "Loki" and select the `Loki`
3. Use the following settings.

### Notes
1. The Log Timestamp is the start time of sky entrypoint being called. There is also an `send_time` in the message indicating the time the message is constructed and send to loki (at the end of the call).
