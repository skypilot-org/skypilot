"""AWS cloud adaptors

Thread safety notes:

The results of session() is cached by each thread in a thread.local() storage.
This means using their results is completely thread-safe.

We do not cache the resource/client objects, because some credentials may be
automatically rotated, but the cached resource/client object may not refresh the
credential quick enough, which can cause unexpected NoCredentialsError. By
creating the resource/client object from the thread-local session() object every
time, the credentials will be explicitly refreshed.

Calling session(), resource(), and client() is thread-safe, since they use a
lock to protect each object's creation.


This is informed by the following boto3 docs:
- Unlike Resources and Sessions, clients are generally thread-safe.
  https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/clients.html
- Resource instances are not thread safe and should not be shared across
  threads or processes
  https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/resources.html
- Similar to Resource objects, Session objects are not thread safe and
  should not be shared across threads and processes.
