# Sky

![pytest](https://github.com/sky-proj/sky/actions/workflows/pytest.yml/badge.svg)

Sky is a tool to run any workload seamlessly across different cloud providers through a unified interface. No knowledge of cloud offerings is required or expected â€“ you simply define the workload and its resource requirements, and Sky will automatically execute it on AWS, Google Cloud Platform or Microsoft Azure.

<!-- TODO: We need a logo here -->
## A Quick Example
The following command can automatically spin up a cluster on the cheapest available cloud fulfilled the required resources, setup and run the commands in the `hello_sky.yaml`
```bash
sky launch -c mycluster hello_sky.yaml
```

```yaml
# hello_sky.yaml
resources:
  accelerators:
    K80:4

setup: |
  # Typical use: pip install -r requirements.txt
  echo "running setup"

run: |
  # Typical use: make use of resources, such as running training.
  echo "hello sky!"
  conda env list
```

## Getting Started
Please refer to our [documentation](https://sky-proj-sky.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/).
- [Installation](https://sky-proj-sky.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/getting-started/installation.html)
- [Quickstart](https://sky-proj-sky.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/getting-started/quickstart.html)
- [Sky CLI](https://sky-proj-sky.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/reference/cli.html)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the sky codebase
git clone ssh://git@github.com:sky-proj/sky.git
cd sky
# Sky requires python >= 3.6.
pip install ".[all]"
```

If you only want the dependencies for certain clouds, you can also use
`".[aws,azure,gcp]"`.

### Cloud Account Setup

Sky currently supports three major cloud providers: AWS, GCP, and Azure.  To run
tasks in the clouds, configure access to at least one cloud:

**AWS**:

```bash
# Install boto
pip install boto3

# Configure your AWS credentials
aws configure
```

To get the **AWS Access Key** required by the :code:`aws configure`, please refer to the [AWS manual](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey). The **Default region name [None]:** and **Default output format [None]:** are optional.

**GCP**:

```bash
pip install google-api-python-client
# Install `gcloud`; see https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart
conda install -c conda-forge google-cloud-sdk

# Init.
gcloud init

# Run this if you don't have a credentials file.
# This will generate ~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json.
gcloud auth application-default login
```

**Azure**:

```bash
# Install the Azure CLI
pip install azure-cli==2.30.0
# Login azure
az login
# Set the subscription to use
az account set -s <subscription_id>
```

**Verifying cloud setup**

Sky allows you to verify that cloud credentials are correctly configured using
the CLI:

```bash
# Verify cloud account setup
sky check
```

This will produce output verifying the correct setup of each supported cloud.

```
Checking credentials to enable clouds for Sky.
  AWS: enabled
  GCP: enabled
  Azure: enabled

Sky will use only the enabled clouds to run tasks. To change this, configure cloud credentials, and run sky check.
```

## Developer Guide
### Setup

```bash
# Sky requires python version >= 3.6

# You can just install the dependencies for
# certain clouds, e.g., ".[aws,azure,gcp]"
pip install -e ".[all]"
```

<!-- TODO (gautam): Removed since we have reversed it -->
<!-- ## SSH Access
The system currently supports SSH access for launched VMs by modifying your local `~/.ssh/config`. For git credentials to forward seamlessly, users must start their SSH agent and add their GitHub SSH key to it:
```
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add -K /path/to/key  # e.g. ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```
For more information on GitHub authentication and keys, see their [setup tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#adding-your-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent). -->

### Some general engineering practice suggestions

These are suggestions, not strict rules to follow. For general coding style, follow [google style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).

* Use `TODO(author_name)`/`FIXME(author_name)` instead of blank `TODO/FIXME`. This is critical for tracking down issues. You can write TODOs with your name and assign it to others (on github) if it is someone else's issue.
* Delete your branch after merging it. This keeps the repo clean and faster to sync.
* Use an exception if this is an error. Only use `assert` for debugging or proof-checking purpose. This is because exception messages usually contain more information.
* Use modern python features and styles that increases code quality.
  * Use f-string instead of `.format()` for short expressions to increase readability.
  * Use `class MyClass:` instead of `class MyClass(object):`. The later one was a workaround for python2.x.
  * Use `abc` module for abstract classes to ensure all abstract methods are implemented.
  * Use python typing. But you should not import external objects just for typing. Instead, import typing-only external objects under `if typing.TYPE_CHECKING:`.
