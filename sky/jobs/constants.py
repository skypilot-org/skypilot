# and n2-highmem-4 (4 vCPUs, 32 GB) for GCP, etc.

# TODO(zhwu): This is no longer accurate, after #4592, which increases the
# length of user hash appended to the cluster name from 4 to 8 chars. This makes
# the cluster name on GCP being wrapped twice. However, we cannot directly
# update this constant, because the job cluster cleanup and many other logic
# in managed jobs depends on this constant, i.e., updating this constant will
# break backward compatibility and existing jobs.
#
# Max length of the cluster name for GCP is 35, the user hash to be attached is
# 4(now 8)+1 chars, and we assume the maximum length of the job id is
# 4(now 8)+1, so the max length of the cluster name prefix is 25(should be 21
# now) to avoid the cluster name being too long and truncated twice during the
# cluster creation.
