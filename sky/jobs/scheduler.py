"""Scheduler for managed jobs.

Once managed jobs are submitted via submit_job, the scheduler is responsible for
the business logic of deciding when they are allowed to start, and choosing the
right one to start. The scheduler will also schedule jobs that are already live
but waiting to launch a new task or recover.

The scheduler is not its own process - instead, maybe_schedule_next_jobs() can
be called from any code running on the managed jobs controller instance to
trigger scheduling of new jobs if possible. This function should be called
immediately after any state change that could result in jobs newly being able to
be scheduled. If the job is running in a pool, the scheduler will only schedule
jobs for the same pool, because the resources limitations are per-pool (see the
following section for more details).

The scheduling logic limits #running jobs according to three limits:
1. The number of jobs that can be launching (that is, STARTING or RECOVERING) at
   once, based on the number of CPUs. This the most compute-intensive part of
   the job lifecycle, which is why we have an additional limit.
   See sky/utils/controller_utils.py::_get_launch_parallelism.
2. The number of jobs that can be running at any given time, based on the amount
   of memory. Since the job controller is doing very little once a job starts
   (just checking its status periodically), the most significant resource it
   consumes is memory.
   See sky/utils/controller_utils.py::_get_job_parallelism.
3. The number of jobs that can be running in a pool at any given time, based on
   the number of ready workers in the pool. (See _can_start_new_job.)

The state of the scheduler is entirely determined by the schedule_state column
of all the jobs in the job_info table. This column should only be modified via
the functions defined in this file. We will always hold the lock while modifying
this state. See state.ManagedJobScheduleState.

Nomenclature:
- job: same as managed job (may include multiple tasks)
- launch/launching: launching a cluster (sky.launch) as part of a job
- start/run: create the job controller process for a job
- schedule: transition a job to the LAUNCHING state, whether a new job or a job
  that is already alive
- alive: a job controller exists (includes multiple schedule_states: ALIVE,
  ALIVE_WAITING, LAUNCHING)

    """Determine if any managed jobs can be scheduled, and if so, schedule them.

    Here, "schedule" means to select job that is waiting, and allow it to
    proceed. It does NOT mean to submit a job to the scheduler.

    For newly submitted jobs, scheduling means updating the state of the jobs,
    and starting the job controller process. For jobs that are already alive but
    are waiting to launch a new task or recover, just update the state of the
    job to indicate that the launch can proceed.

    This function transitions jobs into LAUNCHING on a best-effort basis. That
    is, if we can start any jobs, we will, but if not, we will exit (almost)
    immediately. It's expected that if some WAITING or ALIVE_WAITING jobs cannot
    be started now (either because the lock is held, or because there are not
    enough resources), another call to this function will be made whenever that
    situation is resolved. (If the lock is held, the lock holder should start
    the jobs. If there aren't enough resources, the next controller to exit and
    free up resources should start the jobs.)

    If this function obtains the lock, it will launch as many jobs as possible
    before releasing the lock. This is what allows other calls to exit
    immediately if the lock is held, while ensuring that all jobs are started as
    soon as possible.

    This uses subprocess_utils.launch_new_process_tree() to start the controller
    processes, which should be safe to call from pretty much any code running on
    the jobs controller instance. New job controller processes will be detached
    from the current process and there will not be a parent/child relationship.
    See launch_new_process_tree for more.

    After adding the pool support, this function will be called in a per-pool
    basis. We employ resources limitation for each pool given the number of
    ready workers in the pool. Each pool will have its own scheduler queue,
    indicating by the argument `pool`. Finished job in pool 1 will only trigger
    another jobs in pool 1, but the job in pool 2 will still be waiting. When
    the `pool` argument is None, it schedules a job regardless of the pool.
