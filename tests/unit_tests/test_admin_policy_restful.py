"""Tests for RESTful admin policy functionality.

This test suite focuses on testing the REST-based admin policy architecture,
including serialization, transport, and integration issues that occur when
using RESTful admin policy servers with FastAPI.

Key areas tested:
- JSON/YAML serialization through REST policy servers via admin_policy_utils.apply()
- None key preservation during encoding/decoding in real usage scenarios
- FastAPI integration and request/response handling
- Server lifecycle management and port allocation
- Full policy application flow (like real SkyPilot usage)
