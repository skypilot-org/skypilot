# SkyServe YAML to test the case where the version of the old replicas is incremented
# during update when only the service field of the yaml is changed.
# This requires the service yaml to not contain a work_dir field.
# Otherwise, SkyServe will always create new replicas (with new buckets)
# and delete the old replicas.
# 
# Usage:
#   sky serve up -n bump_version examples/serve/bump_version.yaml
# Edit the yaml by changing replicas from 2 to 3 and run:
#   sky serve update bump_version examples/serve/bump_version.yaml
