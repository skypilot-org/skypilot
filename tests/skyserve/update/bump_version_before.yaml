# SkyServe YAML to test the case where the version of the old replicas is incremented
# during update when only the service field of the yaml is changed.
# This requires the service yaml to not contain a work_dir field.
# Otherwise, SkyServe will always create new replicas (with new buckets)
# and delete the old replicas.
#
# Usage:
#   sky serve up -n bump_version examples/serve/bump_version.yaml
# Edit the yaml by changing replicas from 2 to 3 and run:
#   sky serve update bump_version examples/serve/bump_version.yaml

service:
  readiness_probe:
    path: /health
    initial_delay_seconds: 180  # Use a large delay for EKS LB to be ready
  replicas: 2
