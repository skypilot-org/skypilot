        SkyPilot is a framework for running LLMs, AI, and batch jobs on any cloud, offering maximum cost savings, highest GPU availability, and managed execution.
        SkyPilot abstracts away cloud infra burdens:
        * Launch jobs & clusters on any cloud
        * Easy scale-out: queue and run many jobs, automatically managed
        * Easy access to object stores (S3, GCS, R2)

        SkyPilot maximizes GPU availability for your jobs:
        * Provision in all zones/regions/clouds you have access to (the Sky), with automatic failover

        SkyPilot cuts your cloud costs:
        * Managed Spot: 3-6x cost savings using spot VMs, with auto-recovery from preemptions
        * Optimizer: 2x cost savings by auto-picking the cheapest VM/zone/region/cloud
        * Autostop: hands-free cleanup of idle clusters
        SkyPilot supports your existing GPU, TPU, and CPU workloads, with no code changes.
