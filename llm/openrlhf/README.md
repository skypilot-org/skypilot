# OpenRLHF

These examples are derived from the DPO, RM Training, and SFT samples available at the following URLs — https://openrlhf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/non_rl.html & https://openrlhf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rl.html#supervised-fine-tuning

They set up the environment within a Docker container, following the recommendations in the Quick Start guide (https://openrlhf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick_start.html#installation). The model sizes, batch sizes, and related parameters are scaled down to run efficiently on an 8×A100-40GB cluster and to keep execution time manageable.
