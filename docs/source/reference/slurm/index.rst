Using Slurm
===========

.. note::

    Slurm support is currently in **early access**. If you're interested in trying it out,
    please `fill out this form <https://forms.gle/rfdWQcd9oQgp41Hm8>`_ to get access.

SkyPilot tasks can be run on your Slurm clusters.
The Slurm cluster gets added to the list of "clouds" in SkyPilot and SkyPilot
tasks can be submitted to your Slurm cluster just like any other cloud provider.
