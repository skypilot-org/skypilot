Running on Kubernetes
=============================

SkyPilot tasks can be run on your private on-prem or cloud Kubernetes clusters.
The Kubernetes cluster gets added to the list of "clouds" in SkyPilot and SkyPilot
tasks can be submitted to your Kubernetes cluster just like any other cloud provider.

Why use SkyPilot on Kubernetes?

                    TODO(romilb): We should have a comparison of a popular Kubernetes manifest vs a SkyPilot YAML in terms of LoC in a mini blog and link it here.

                No complex kubernetes manifests - write a simple SkyPilot YAML and run with one command ``sky launch``.
