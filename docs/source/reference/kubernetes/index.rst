Running on Kubernetes
=============================

.. note::
    Kubernetes support is under active development. `Please share your feedback <https://forms.gle/KmAtyNhEysiw2ZCR7>`_
    or `directly reach out to the development team <http://slack.skypilot.co>`_
    for feature requests and more.

SkyPilot tasks can be run on your private on-prem or cloud Kubernetes clusters.
The Kubernetes cluster gets added to the list of "clouds" in SkyPilot and SkyPilot
tasks can be submitted to your Kubernetes cluster just like any other cloud provider.

**Benefits of using SkyPilot to run jobs on your Kubernetes cluster:**

* Get SkyPilot features (setup management, job execution, queuing, logging, SSH access) on your Kubernetes resources
* Replace complex Kubernetes manifests with simple SkyPilot tasks
* Seamlessly "burst" jobs to the cloud if your Kubernetes cluster is congested
* Retain observability and control over your cluster with your existing Kubernetes tools

**Supported Kubernetes deployments:**

* Hosted Kubernetes services (EKS, GKE)
* On-prem clusters (Kubeadm, Rancher)
* Local development clusters (KinD, minikube)


Kubernetes Cluster Requirements
-------------------------------

To connect and use a Kubernetes cluster, SkyPilot needs:

* An existing Kubernetes cluster running Kubernetes v1.20 or later.
* A `Kubeconfig <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/>`_ file containing access credentials and namespace to be used.

In a typical workflow:

1. A cluster administrator sets up a Kubernetes cluster. Detailed admin guides for
   different deployment environments (Amazon EKS, Google GKE, On-Prem and local debugging) are included in the :ref:`Kubernetes cluster setup guide <kubernetes-setup>`.

2. Users who want to run SkyPilot tasks on this cluster are issued Kubeconfig
   files containing their credentials (`kube-context <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/#define-clusters-users-and-contexts>`_).
   SkyPilot reads this Kubeconfig file to communicate with the cluster.

Submitting SkyPilot tasks to Kubernetes Clusters
------------------------------------------------
.. _kubernetes-instructions:

Once your cluster administrator has :ref:`setup a Kubernetes cluster <kubernetes-setup>` and provided you with a kubeconfig file:

0. Make sure `kubectl <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/>`_, ``socat`` and ``nc`` (netcat) are installed on your local machine.

   .. code-block:: console

     $ # MacOS
     $ brew install kubectl socat netcat

     $ # Linux (may have socat already installed)
     $ sudo apt-get install kubectl socat netcat


1. Place your kubeconfig file at ``~/.kube/config``.

   .. code-block:: console

     $ mkdir -p ~/.kube
     $ cp /path/to/kubeconfig ~/.kube/config

   You can verify your credentials are setup correctly by running :code:`kubectl get pods`.

2. Run :code:`sky check` and verify that Kubernetes is enabled in SkyPilot.

   .. code-block:: console

     $ sky check

     Checking credentials to enable clouds for SkyPilot.
     ...
     Kubernetes: enabled
     ...


   .. note::
     :code:`sky check` will also check if GPU support is available on your cluster. If GPU support is not available, it
     will show the reason.
     To setup GPU support on the cluster, refer to the :ref:`Kubernetes cluster setup guide <kubernetes-setup>`.

4. You can now run any SkyPilot task on your Kubernetes cluster.

   .. code-block:: console

        $ sky launch --cpus 2+ task.yaml
        == Optimizer ==
        Target: minimizing cost
        Estimated cost: $0.0 / hour

        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.


.. note::
  SkyPilot will use the cluster and namespace set in the ``current-context`` in the
  kubeconfig file. To manage your ``current-context``:

  .. code-block:: console

    $ # See current context
    $ kubectl config current-context

    $ # Switch current-context
    $ kubectl config use-context mycontext

    $ # Set a specific namespace to be used in the current-context
    $ kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=mynamespace


Using Custom Images
-------------------
By default, we use and maintain a SkyPilot container image that has conda and a few other basic tools installed.

To use your own image, add :code:`image_id: docker:<your image tag>` to the :code:`resources` section of your task YAML.

.. code-block:: yaml

    resources:
      image_id: docker:myrepo/myimage:latest
    ...

Your image must satisfy the following requirements:

* Image must be **debian-based** and must have the apt package manager installed.
* The default user in the image must have root privileges or passwordless sudo access.

.. note::

    If your cluster runs on non-x86_64 architecture (e.g., Apple Silicon), your image must be built natively for that architecture. Otherwise, your job may get stuck at :code:`Start streaming logs ...`. See `GitHub issue <https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot/issues/3035>`_ for more.

Using Images from Private Repositories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To use images from private repositories (e.g., Private DockerHub, Amazon ECR, Google Container Registry), create a `secret <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/#create-a-secret-by-providing-credentials-on-the-command-line>`_ in your Kubernetes cluster and edit your :code:`~/.sky/config` to specify the secret like so:

.. code-block:: yaml

    kubernetes:
      pod_config:
        spec:
          imagePullSecrets:
            - name: your-secret-here

.. tip::

    If you use Amazon ECR, your secret credentials may expire every 12 hours. Consider using `k8s-ecr-login-renew <https://github.com/nabsul/k8s-ecr-login-renew>`_ to automatically refresh your secrets.


Opening Ports
-------------

Opening ports on SkyPilot clusters running on Kubernetes is supported through two modes:

1. `LoadBalancer services <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer>`_ (default)
2. `Nginx IngressController <https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/>`_

One of these modes must be supported and configured on your cluster. Refer to the :ref:`setting up ports on Kubernetes guide <kubernetes-ports>` on how to do this.

.. tip::

  On Google GKE, Amazon EKS or other cloud-hosted Kubernetes services, the default LoadBalancer services mode is supported out of the box and no additional configuration is needed.

Once your cluster is  configured, launch a task which exposes services on a port by adding :code:`ports` to the :code:`resources` section of your task YAML.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # task.yaml
    resources:
      ports: 8888

    run: |
      python -m http.server 8888

After launching the cluster with :code:`sky launch -c myclus task.yaml`, you can get the URL to access the port using :code:`sky status --endpoints myclus`.

.. code-block:: bash

    # List all ports exposed by the cluster
    $ sky status --endpoints myclus
    8888: 34.173.13.241:8888

    # curl a specific port's endpoint
    $ curl $(sky status --endpoint 8888 myclus)
    ...

.. tip::

    To learn more about opening ports in SkyPilot tasks, see :ref:`Opening Ports <ports>`.

FAQs
----

* **Are autoscaling Kubernetes clusters supported?**

  To run on an autoscaling cluster, you may need to adjust the resource provisioning timeout (:code:`Kubernetes.TIMEOUT` in `clouds/kubernetes.py`) to a large value to give enough time for the cluster to autoscale. We are working on a better interface to adjust this timeout - stay tuned!

* **Can SkyPilot provision a Kubernetes cluster for me? Will SkyPilot add more nodes to my Kubernetes clusters?**

  The goal of Kubernetes support is to run SkyPilot tasks on an existing Kubernetes cluster. It does not provision any new Kubernetes clusters or add new nodes to an existing Kubernetes cluster.

* **I have multiple users in my organization who share the same Kubernetes cluster. How do I provide isolation for their SkyPilot workloads?**

  For isolation, you can create separate Kubernetes namespaces and set them in the kubeconfig distributed to users. SkyPilot will use the namespace set in the kubeconfig for running all tasks.

* **How can I specify custom configuration for the pods created by SkyPilot?**

  You can override the pod configuration used by SkyPilot by setting the :code:`pod_config` key in :code:`~/.sky/config.yaml`.
  The value of :code:`pod_config` should be a dictionary that follows the `Kubernetes Pod API <https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.22/#pod-v1-core>`_.

  For example, to set custom environment variables in the pod, you can add the following to your :code:`~/.sky/config.yaml` file:

  .. code-block:: yaml

      kubernetes:
        pod_config:
          spec:
            containers:
              - env:
                - name: MY_ENV_VAR
                  value: MY_ENV_VALUE

  For more details refer to :ref:`config-yaml`.
