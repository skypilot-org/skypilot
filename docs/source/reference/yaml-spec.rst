Task YAML
=========

SkyPilot provides an intuitive YAML interface to specify a task (resource requirements, setup commands, run commands, file mounts, storage mounts, and so on).

Task YAMLs can be used with the :ref:`CLI <cli>`, or the programmatic API (:meth:`sky.Task.from_yaml`).

Available fields:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Task name (optional), used for display purposes.
    name: my-task

    # Working directory (optional), synced to ~/sky_workdir on the remote cluster
    # each time launch or exec is run with the yaml file.
    #
    # Commands in "setup" and "run" will be executed under it.
    #
    # If a relative path is used, it's evaluated relative to the location from 
    # which `sky` is called.
    #
    # If a .gitignore file (or a .git/info/exclude file) exists in the working
    # directory, files and directories listed in it will be excluded from syncing.
    workdir: ~/my-task-code

    # Number of nodes (optional; defaults to 1) to launch including the head node.
    #
    # A task can set this to a smaller value than the size of a cluster.
    num_nodes: 4

    # Per-node resource requirements (optional).
    resources:
      cloud: aws  # The cloud to use (optional).

      # The region to use (optional). Auto-failover will be disabled
      # if this is specified.
      region: us-east-1

      # The zone to use (optional). Auto-failover will be disabled
      # if this is specified.
      zone: us-east-1a

      # Accelerator name and count per node (optional).
      #
      # Use `sky show-gpus` to view available accelerator configurations.
      #
      # The following three ways are valid for specifying accelerators for a cluster:
      #
      #   To specify a single type of accelerator:
      #     Format: <name>:<count> (or simply <name>, short for a count of 1).
      #     accelerators: V100:4
      #
      #   To specify an ordered list of accelerators (try the accelerators in
      #   the specified order):
      #     Format: [<name>:<count>, ...]
      #     accelerators: ['K80:1', 'V100:1', 'T4:1']
      #
      #   To specify an unordered set of accelerators (optimize all specified
      #   accelerators together, and try accelerator with lowest cost first):
      #     Format: {<name>:<count>, ...}
      #     accelerators: {'K80:1', 'V100:1', 'T4:1'}
      accelerators: V100:4

      # Number of vCPUs per node (optional).
      #
      # Format:
      #   <count>: exactly <count> vCPUs
      #   <count>+: at least <count> vCPUs
      #
      # E.g., 4+ means first try to find an instance type with >= 4 vCPUs. If
      # not found, use the next cheapest instance with more than 4 vCPUs.
      cpus: 4+

      # Memory in GiB per node (optional).
      #
      # Format:
      #  <num>: exactly <num> GiB
      #  <num>+: at least <num> GiB
      #
      # E.g., 32+ means first try to find an instance type with >= 32 GiB. If
      # not found, use the next cheapest instance with more than 32 GiB.
      memory: 32+

      # Instance type to use (optional). If 'accelerators' is specified,
      # the corresponding instance type is automatically inferred.
      instance_type: p3.8xlarge

      # Whether the cluster should use spot instances (optional).
      # If unspecified, defaults to False (on-demand instances).
      use_spot: False

      # The recovery strategy for managed jobs (optional).
      #
      # In effect for managed jobs. Possible values are `FAILOVER` and `EAGER_NEXT_REGION`.
      #
      # If `FAILOVER` is specified, the job will be restarted in the same region
      # if the node fails, and go to the next region if no available resources
      # are found in the same region. 
      #
      # If `EAGER_NEXT_REGION` is specified, the job will go to the next region
      # directly if the node fails. This is useful for spot instances, as in
      # practice, preemptions in a region usually indicate a shortage of resources
      # in that region.
      #
      # default: EAGER_NEXT_REGION
      job_recovery: none

      # Disk size in GB to allocate for OS (mounted at /). Increase this if you
      # have a large working directory or tasks that write out large outputs.
      disk_size: 256

      # Disk tier to use for OS (optional).
      # Could be one of 'low', 'medium', 'high' or 'best' (default: 'medium').
      # if 'best' is specified, use the best disk tier enabled.
      # Rough performance estimate:
      #   low: 500 IOPS; read 20MB/s; write 40 MB/s
      #   medium: 3000 IOPS; read 220 MB/s; write 200 MB/s
      #   high: 6000 IOPS; 340 MB/s; write 250 MB/s
      disk_tier: medium

      # Ports to expose (optional).
      #
      # All ports specified here will be exposed to the public Internet. Under
      # the hood, a firewall rule / inbound rule is automatically added to allow
      # inbound traffic to these ports. Applies to all VMs of a cluster created
      # with this field set.
      #
      # Currently only TCP protocol is supported.
      #
      # Ports Lifecycle:
      # A cluster's ports will be updated whenever `sky launch` is executed.
      # When launching an existing cluster, any new ports specified will be
      # opened for the cluster, and the firewall rules for old ports will never
      # be removed until the cluster is terminated.
      #
      # Could be an integer, a range, or a list of integers and ranges:
      #   To specify a single port:
      #     ports: 8081
      #   To specify a port range:
      #     ports: 10052-10100
      #   To specify multiple ports / port ranges:
      #     ports:
      #       - 8080
      #       - 10022-10040
      ports: 8081

      # Additional accelerator metadata (optional); only used for TPU node
      # and TPU VM.
      # Example usage:
      #
      #   To request a TPU VM:
      #     accelerator_args:
      #       tpu_vm: True (optional, default: True)
      #
      #   To request a TPU node:
      #     accelerator_args:
      #       tpu_name: ...
      #       tpu_vm: False
      #
      # By default, the value for "runtime_version" is decided based on which is
      # requested and should work for either case. If passing in an incompatible
      # version, GCP will throw an error during provisioning.
      accelerator_args:
        # Default is "tpu-vm-base" for TPU VM and "2.12.0" for TPU node.
        runtime_version: tpu-vm-base
      # tpu_name: mytpu
      # tpu_vm: True  # True to use TPU VM (the default); False to use TPU node.

      # Custom image id (optional, advanced). The image id used to boot the
      # instances. Only supported for AWS and GCP (for non-docker image). If not
      # specified, SkyPilot will use the default debian-based image suitable for
      # machine learning tasks.
      #
      # Docker support
      # You can specify docker image to use by setting the image_id to
      # `docker:<image name>` for Azure, AWS and GCP. For example,
      #   image_id: docker:ubuntu:latest
      # Currently, only debian and ubuntu images are supported.
      # If you want to use a docker image in a private registry, you can specify your
      # username, password, and registry server as task environment variable. For
      # details, please refer to the `envs` section below.
      #
      # AWS
      # To find AWS AMI ids: https://leaherb.com/how-to-find-an-aws-marketplace-ami-image-id
      # You can also change the default OS version by choosing from the
      # following image tags provided by SkyPilot:
      #   image_id: skypilot:gpu-ubuntu-2004
      #   image_id: skypilot:k80-ubuntu-2004
      #   image_id: skypilot:gpu-ubuntu-1804
      #   image_id: skypilot:k80-ubuntu-1804
      #
      # It is also possible to specify a per-region image id (failover will only
      # go through the regions specified as keys; useful when you have the
      # custom images in multiple regions):
      #   image_id:
      #     us-east-1: ami-0729d913a335efca7
      #     us-west-2: ami-050814f384259894c
      image_id: ami-0868a20f5a3bf9702
      # GCP
      # To find GCP images: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images
      # image_id: projects/deeplearning-platform-release/global/images/common-cpu-v20230615-debian-11-py310
      # Or machine image: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-images

      # To create an image manually:
      # https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-and-using-an-image-from-volume.
      # To use an official VPC image creation tool:

      # To use a more limited but easier to manage tool:
      # https://github.com/IBM/vpc-img-inst

      # Labels to apply to the instances (optional).
      #
      # If specified, these labels will be applied to the VMs or pods created
      # by SkyPilot. These are useful for assigning metadata that may be
      # used by external tools. Implementation depends on the chosen cloud -
      # On AWS, labels map to instance tags. On GCP, labels map to instance
      # labels. On Kubernetes, labels map to pod labels. On other clouds,
      # labels are not supported and will be ignored.
      #
      # Note: Labels are applied only on the first launch of the cluster. They
      # are not updated on subsequent launches.
      labels:
        my-label: my-value

      # Candidate resources (optional). If specified, SkyPilot will only use
      # these candidate resources to launch the cluster. The fields specified
      # outside of `any_of`, `ordered` will be used as the default values for
      # all candidate resources, and any duplicate fields specified inside
      # `any_of`, `ordered` will override the default values.
      # `any_of:` means that SkyPilot will try to find a resource that matches
      # any of the candidate resources, i.e. the failover order will be decided
      # by the optimizer.
      # `ordered:` means that SkyPilot will failover through the candidate
      # resources with the specified order.
      # Note: accelerators under `any_of` and `ordered` cannot be a list or set.
      any_of:
        - cloud: aws
          region: us-west-2
          acceraltors: V100
        - cloud: gcp
          acceraltors: A100


    # Environment variables (optional). These values can be accessed in the
    # `file_mounts`, `setup`, and `run` sections below.
    #
    # Values set here can be overridden by a CLI flag:
    # `sky launch/exec --env ENV=val` (if ENV is present).
    #
    # If you want to use a docker image as runtime environment in a private
    # registry, you can specify your username, password, and registry server as
    # task environment variable.  For example:
    #   envs:
    #     SKYPILOT_DOCKER_USERNAME: <username>
    #     SKYPILOT_DOCKER_PASSWORD: <password>
    #     SKYPILOT_DOCKER_SERVER: <registry server>
    #
    # SkyPilot will execute `docker login --username <username> --password
    # <password> <registry server>` before pulling the docker image. For `docker
    # login`, see https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/
    #
    # You could also specify any of them through the CLI flag if you don't want
    # to store them in your yaml file or if you want to generate them for
    # constantly changing password. For example:
    #   sky launch --env SKYPILOT_DOCKER_PASSWORD=$(aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1).
    #
    # For more information about docker support in SkyPilot, please refer to the `image_id` section above.
