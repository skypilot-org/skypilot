Cluster YAML Configuration
======================

Sky On-prem's cluster config simplifies the system administrator's job with a simple YAML interface, which includes cluster-specific hyperparameters and an authentication method. The admin maintains a **private** cluster YAML and publishes a public **distributable** cluster YAML, which is generated by Sky, for regular users.

All fields are described below:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Header for cluster specific data.
    #
    # This field appears for both private and distributable cluster YAMLs.
    cluster:
      # List of IPS/hostnames in the cluster. The first element is the head node.
      ips: [my.local.cluster.hostname, 3.20.226.96, 3.143.112.6]
      name: my-local-cluster

    # How users authenticate into the local cluster
    auth:
      ssh_user: ubuntu  # User account.
      ssh_private_key: ~/.ssh/ubuntu.pem  # Private keypair.
