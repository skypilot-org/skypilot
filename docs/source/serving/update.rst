Update Your Service
===========

SkyServe supports update for your services. Use ``sky serve update`` to update an existing service:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sky serve update service-name new_service.yaml

SkyServe will launch new replicas described by ``new_service.yaml``. When the number of new replicas reaches the minimum number of replicas (``min_replicas``) required for the service, SkyServe will scale down old replicas to save cost. During the whole process, the service is still accessible to users. SkyServe allows users to update ``replica_policy`` parameters, such as ``target_qps_per_replica``. SkyServe also allows users to update ``resources`` parameters, such as ``cpu`` and ``memory``, so that new replicas can be launched on VMs of different types.   

For example, suppose we have a running service hosting Llama 2 model with the following resource configuration: 

.. code-block:: yaml

    resources:
        memory: 32+
        accelerators: T4

SkyServe supports updating an existing service to a new resource configuration, such as:

.. code-block:: yaml

    resources:
        memory: 128+
        accelerators: A100

SkyServe does not mix traffic from old and new replicas and will not send traffic to new replicas until ``min_replicas`` new replicas are ready to serve user requests. Before that, SkyServe will only send traffic to the old replicas. The SkyServe endpoint will remain the same during the update process and will remain accessible with no downtime.

.. tip::

  :code:`sky serve status` will highlight the latest service version and each replica's version. 

Example
===========

We first launch an HTTP service: 

.. code-block:: console

    $ sky serve up examples/serve/http_server/task.yaml -n http-server

We can use :code:`sky serve status http-server` to check the status of the service:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sky serve status http-server

    Services
    NAME         VERSION  UPTIME  STATUS  REPLICAS  ENDPOINT              
    http-server  1        1m 41s  READY   2/2       44.206.240.249:30002  

    Service Replicas
    SERVICE_NAME  ID  VERSION  IP              LAUNCHED    RESOURCES       STATUS  REGION     
    http-server   1   1        54.173.203.169  2 mins ago  1x AWS(vCPU=2)  READY   us-east-1  
    http-server   2   1        52.87.241.103   2 mins ago  1x AWS(vCPU=2)  READY   us-east-1 

Service ``http-server`` has an initial version of 1. Suppose we want to update the service to use 4 CPUs instead of 2, we can update the task yaml ``examples/serve/http_server/task.yaml``, by changing the ``cpu`` parameter from 2 to 4. We can then use :code:`sky serve update` to update the service:

That is, we update the cpus field of the YAML file from 2 to 4:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :emphasize-lines: 8

    # examples/serve/http_server/task.yaml
    service:
        readiness_probe: /
        replicas: 1

    resources:
        ports: 8081
        cpus: 4+

    workdir: .

    run: python3 server.py


.. code-block:: console

    $ sky serve update http-server examples/serve/http_server/task.yaml

SkyServe will first launch two new replicas with 4 CPUs. When the number of new replicas reaches the ``min_replicas`` (i.e., 2) required for the service, SkyServe will scale down old replicas to save cost. The service's version is updated from 1 to 2. The replicas with ID 3 and 4 are the new replicas with 4 CPUs. The replicas with ID 1 and 2 are the old replicas with 2 CPUs. When the new replicas are still provisioning, SkyServe will only send traffic to the old replicas.

.. code-block:: console

    $ sky serve status http-server

    http-server   4   2        -               21 secs ago  1x AWS(vCPU=4)  PROVISIONING  us-east-1

The old replicas will be scaled down when the new replicas are ready. At this point, SkyServe will start sending traffic to the new replicas.

.. code-block:: console

    $ sky serve status http-server

    Services
    NAME         VERSION  UPTIME  STATUS  REPLICAS  ENDPOINT

Eventually, we will only have new replicas ready to serve user requests.
