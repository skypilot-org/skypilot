Using Docker Containers
=======================

SkyPilot can run a Docker container either as the runtime environment for your task, or as the task itself.

Using Docker Containers as Runtime Environment
----------------------------------------------

When a container is used as the runtime environment, the SkyPilot task is executed inside the container.

This means all :code:`setup` and :code:`run` commands in the YAML file will be executed in the container, and any files created by the task will be stored inside the container.
Any GPUs assigned to the task will be automatically mapped to your Docker container and all future tasks on the cluster will also execute in the container.

To use a Docker image as your runtime environment, set the :code:`image_id` field in the :code:`resources` section of your task YAML file to :code:`docker:<image_id>`.
For example, to use the :code:`ubuntu:20.04` image from Docker Hub:

.. code-block:: yaml

  resources:
    image_id: docker:ubuntu:20.04

  setup: |
    # Will run inside container

  run: |
    # Will run inside container

For Docker images hosted on private registries, you can provide the registry authentication details using the :code:`envs` section:

.. code-block:: yaml

  # private_docker.yaml
  resources:
    image_id: docker:<your-private-image>:<tag>

  envs:
    SKYPILOT_DOCKER_USERNAME: <username>
    SKYPILOT_DOCKER_PASSWORD: <password>
    SKYPILOT_DOCKER_SERVER: <server>

Alternatively, you can set these environment variables directly through the CLI:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ sky launch \
      --env SKYPILOT_DOCKER_PASSWORD=$(aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1) \
      --env SKYPILOT_DOCKER_USERNAME=AWS \
      private_docker.yaml

Running Docker Containers as Tasks
----------------------------------

As an alternative, SkyPilot can run docker containers as tasks. Docker runtime is configured and ready for use on the default VM image used by SkyPilot.

To run a container as a task, you can directly invoke the :code:`docker run` command in the :code:`run` section of your task.

For example, to run a GPU-accelerated container that prints the output of :code:`nvidia-smi`:

.. code-block:: yaml

  resources:
    accelerators: V100:1

  run: |
    docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:11.6.2-base-ubuntu20.04 nvidia-smi

Building containers remotely
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are running the container as a task, the container image can also be built remotely on the cluster in the :code:`setup` phase of the task.

The :code:`echo_app` `example <https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot/tree/master/examples/docker>`_ provides an example on how to do this:

.. code-block:: yaml

  file_mounts:
    /inputs: ./echo_app  # Input to application
    /echo_app: ./echo_app  # Contains the Dockerfile and build context
    /outputs:  # Output to be written directly to S3 bucket
      name: # Set unique bucket name here
      store: s3
      mode: MOUNT

  setup: |
    # Build docker image. If pushed to a registry, can also do docker pull here
    docker build -t echo:v0 /echo_app

  run: |
    docker run --rm \
    --volume="/inputs:/inputs:ro" \
    --volume="/outputs:/outputs:rw" \
    echo:v0 \
    /inputs/README.md /outputs/output.txt

In this example, the Dockerfile and build context are contained in :code:`./echo_app`.
The :code:`setup` phase of the task builds the image, and the :code:`run` phase runs the container.
The inputs to the app are copied to SkyPilot using :code:`file_mounts` and mounted into the container using docker volume mounts (:code:`--volume` flag).
The output of the app produced at :code:`/outputs` path in the container is also volume mounted to :code:`/outputs` on the VM, which gets directly written to a S3 bucket through SkyPilot Storage mounting.

Our GitHub repository has more examples, including running `Detectron2 in a Docker container <https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot/blob/master/examples/detectron2_docker.yaml>`_ via SkyPilot.
