Using Docker Containers
=======================

SkyPilot can run a container either as a task, or as the runtime environment of a cluster.

* If the container image is invocable / has an entrypoint: run it :ref:`as a task <docker-containers-as-tasks>`.
* Otherwise, the container image is likely to be used as a runtime environment (e.g., ``ubuntu``) and you likely have extra commands to run inside the container: run it :ref:`as a runtime environment <docker-containers-as-runtime-environments>`.

.. _docker-containers-as-tasks:

Running Containers as Tasks
---------------------------

SkyPilot can run containerized applications directly as regular tasks. The default VM images provided by SkyPilot already have the Docker runtime pre-configured.

To launch a containerized application, you can directly invoke :code:`docker run` in the :code:`run` section of your task.

For example, to run a HuggingFace TGI serving container:

.. code-block:: yaml

  resources:
    accelerators: A100:1

  run: |
    docker run --gpus all --shm-size 1g -v ~/data:/data \
      ghcr.io/huggingface/text-generation-inference \
      --model-id lmsys/vicuna-13b-v1.5

    # NOTE: Uncommon to have any commands after the above.
    # `docker run` is blocking, so any commands after it
    # will NOT be run inside the container.

Private Registries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When using this mode, to access Docker images hosted on private registries,
simply add a :code:`setup` section to your task YAML file to authenticate with
the registry:

.. code-block:: yaml

  resources:
    accelerators: A100:1

  setup: |
    # Authenticate with private registry
    docker login -u <username> -p <password> <registry>

  run: |
    docker run <registry>/<image>:<tag>

Building containers remotely
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are running containerized applications, the container image can also be built remotely on the cluster in the :code:`setup` phase of the task.

The :code:`echo_app` `example <https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot/tree/master/examples/docker>`_ provides an example on how to do this:

.. code-block:: yaml

  file_mounts:
    /inputs: ./echo_app  # Input to application
    /echo_app: ./echo_app  # Contains the Dockerfile and build context
    /outputs:  # Output to be written directly to S3 bucket
      name: # Set unique bucket name here
      store: s3
      mode: MOUNT

  setup: |
    # Build docker image. If pushed to a registry, can also do docker pull here
    docker build -t echo:v0 /echo_app

  run: |
    docker run --rm \
      --volume="/inputs:/inputs:ro" \
      --volume="/outputs:/outputs:rw" \
      echo:v0 \
      /inputs/README.md /outputs/output.txt

In this example, the Dockerfile and build context are contained in :code:`./echo_app`.
The :code:`setup` phase of the task builds the image, and the :code:`run` phase runs the container.
The inputs to the app are copied to SkyPilot using :code:`file_mounts` and mounted into the container using docker volume mounts (:code:`--volume` flag).
The output of the app produced at :code:`/outputs` path in the container is also volume mounted to :code:`/outputs` on the VM, which gets directly written to a S3 bucket through SkyPilot Storage mounting.

Our GitHub repository has more examples, including running `Detectron2 in a Docker container <https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot/blob/master/examples/detectron2_docker.yaml>`_ via SkyPilot.

.. _docker-containers-as-runtime-environments:

Using Containers as Runtime Environments
----------------------------------------

When a container is used as the runtime environment, everything happens inside the container:

- The SkyPilot runtime is automatically installed and launched inside the container;
- :code:`setup` and :code:`run` commands are executed in the container;
- Any files created by the task will be stored inside the container.

To use a Docker image as your runtime environment, set the :code:`image_id` field in the :code:`resources` section of your task YAML file to :code:`docker:<image_id>`.
For example, to use the :code:`ubuntu:20.04` image from Docker Hub:

.. code-block:: yaml

  resources:
    image_id: docker:ubuntu:20.04

  setup: |
    # Commands to run inside the container

  run: |
    # Commands to run inside the container

Any GPUs assigned to the task will be automatically mapped to your Docker container, and all subsequent tasks within the cluster will also run inside the container. In a multi-node scenario, the container will be launched on all nodes, and the corresponding node's container will be assigned for task execution.

.. tip::

    **When to use this?**

    If you have a preconfigured development environment set up within a Docker
    image, it can be convenient to use the runtime environment mode.  This is
    especially useful for launching development environments that are
    challenging to configure on a new virtual machine, such as dependencies on
    specific versions of CUDA or cuDNN.

.. note::

    Since we ``pip install skypilot`` inside the user-specified container image
    as part of a launch, users should ensure dependency conflicts do not occur.

    Currently, the following requirements must be met:

    1. The container image should be based on Debian;

    2. The container image must grant sudo permissions without requiring password authentication for the user. Having a root user is also acceptable.

Private Registries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When using this mode, to access Docker images hosted on private registries,
you can provide the registry authentication details using :ref:`task environment variables <env-vars>`:

.. code-block:: yaml

  # ecr_private_docker.yaml
  resources:
    image_id: docker:<your-user-id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/<your-private-image>:<tag>
    # the following shorthand is also supported:
    # image_id: docker:<your-private-image>:<tag>

  envs:
    SKYPILOT_DOCKER_USERNAME: AWS
    # SKYPILOT_DOCKER_PASSWORD: <password>
    SKYPILOT_DOCKER_SERVER: <your-user-id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

We suggest setting the :code:`SKYPILOT_DOCKER_PASSWORD` environment variable through the CLI (see :ref:`passing secrets <passing-secrets>`):

.. code-block:: console

  $ export SKYPILOT_DOCKER_PASSWORD=$(aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1)
  $ sky launch ecr_private_docker.yaml --env SKYPILOT_DOCKER_PASSWORD
