.. _auto-failover:

Auto-provisioning GPUs
==========================

SkyPilot comes with an *auto-failover provisioner*, which
**automatically retries provisioning a cluster in different regions (or
clouds)** if the requested resources cannot be provisioned.
Such provisioning failures can happen for a variety of reasons:

- insufficient capacity (in a region or a cloud)
- insufficient quotas (in a region or a cloud)

Auto-failover is especially useful for requesting scarce resources such as GPUs
and other accelerators.  The user is **freed from manually searching for regions
(or clouds) that can provide the requested resources**.

.. note::

  Auto-failover is automatically enabled whenever a new cluster is to be
  provisioned, such as during :code:`sky launch` or the :ref:`interactive node
  commands <interactive-nodes>` :code:`sky {gpunode,cpunode,tpunode}`. If the
  :code:`cloud` field is specified in resources, then auto-failover retries only
  within the specified cloud.

Cross-region failover
---------------------

The provisioner first retries across all regions within a task's chosen cloud.

A common high-end GPU to use in deep learning is a NVIDIA V100 GPU.  These GPUs
are often in high demand and hard to get.  Let's see how SkyPilot's auto-failover
provisioner handles such a request:

GCP was chosen as the best cloud to run the task. There was no capacity in any of the regions in US Central, so the auto-failover provisioner moved to US West instead, allowing for our instance to be successfully provisioned.

Cross-cloud failover
---------------------
If all regions within the chosen cloud failed, the provisioner retries on the next
cheapest cloud.

Here is an example of cross-cloud failover when requesting 8x V100 GPUs.  All
regions in GCP failed to provide the resource, so the provisioner switched to
AWS, where it succeeded after two regions:
