Setting Up SkyPilot with Airgapping
====================================

SkyPilot is compatible with any airgapped setup that allows downloading our required packages via a proxy (for example via an HTTP proxy or Amazon SSM).
This guide details how to setup SkyPilot in these cases.

.. _airgap-aws-ssm:

AWS SSM
~~~~~~~

AWS Systems Manager Session Manager allows for secure shell access to EC2 instances without direct network access.
This enables an airgapped setup where launched instances donâ€™t have a public IP address but you can still access the instances.

Assume we have a private VPC for our airgapped AWS cluster with the name ``private-vpc`` and a private security group ``private-sg`` where we want to launch a SkyPilot cluster. We can use a very simple yaml file to enable SkyPilot. 

.. code-block:: yaml

    # ~/.sky/config.yaml
    aws:
        vpc_name: <private-vpc>
        security_group_name: <private-sg>
        use_internal_ips: true
        use_ssm: true

With only a small set of additional configuration we can have SkyPilot use the
directed VPC and security group and create a cluster in AWS using private IPs (as a result of ``use_internal_ips: true``) only relying on SSM for connectivity.

See :ref:`Using AWS Systems Manager SSM <aws-ssm>` for further instructions on setting up SSM in SkyPilot including required packages and permissions.

.. _airgap-kubernetes:

Kubernetes with HTTP proxies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SkyPilot can also support airgapped Kubernetes clusters that use an HTTP proxy to enable outbound traffic.

Assume we have a Kubernetes cluster with a corporate HTTP proxy at ``http://proxy-host:3128``. We can use a very simple yaml file to enable SkyPilot.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # ~/.sky/config.yaml
    kubernetes:
      pod_config:
        spec:
          containers:
            - env:
                - name: HTTP_PROXY
                  value: http://proxy-host:3128
                - name: HTTPS_PROXY
                  value: http://proxy-host:3128
                - name: NO_PROXY
                  value: localhost,127.0.0.1
                - name: http_proxy
                  value: http://proxy-host:3128
                - name: https_proxy
                  value: http://proxy-host:3128
                - name: no_proxy
                  value: localhost,127.0.0.1

``NO_PROXY`` is used to specify the addresses that should be excluded from the proxy, typically internal addresses.
Because different tools and libraries use different environment variable names, we include all the possible names to ensure compatibility.

This configuration guarantees that all SkyPilot pods will be configured to use the corporate proxy for outbound traffic.
