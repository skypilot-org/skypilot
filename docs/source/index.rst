SkyPilot is a framework for easily running machine learning workloads on any cloud through a unified interface.

No knowledge of cloud offerings is required or expected – you simply define the workload and its resource requirements, and SkyPilot will automatically execute it on AWS, Google Cloud Platform or Microsoft Azure.

Key features:

- **Run existing projects on the cloud** with zero code changes
- **No cloud lock-in** – seamlessly run your code across different cloud providers (AWS, Azure or GCP)
- **Minimize costs** by leveraging spot instances and automatically stopping idle clusters
- **Automatic recovery from spot instance failures**
- **Automatic fail-over** to find resources across regions and clouds
- **Store datasets on the cloud** and access them like you would on a local file system
- **Easily manage job queues** across multiple clusters
