Storage
=======

A Sky Storage object represents an abstract data store containing large data
files required by the task. Compared to file_mounts, storage is faster and
can persist across runs, requiring fewer uploads from your local machine.
Behind the scenes, storage automatically uploads all data in the source
to a backing object store in a particular cloud (S3/GCS/Azure Blob).

A storage object is used by "mounting" it to a task. On mounting, the data
specified in the source becomes available at the destination mount_path.
Please note that sky.Storage does not guarantee preservation of file
permissions - you may need to set file permissions during task execution.

Using Sky Storage
-----------------
Sky Storage can be used by specifying additional fields in the
:code:`file_mounts`. By default, :code:`file_mounts` uses rsync to
directly copy files from local to remote VM.
However, you can have them backed by sky Storage, which uploads
the files to a cloud store (e.g. S3, GCS) and have them persist there by
specifying the :code:`name`, :code:`source` and :code:`persistent` fields. By
enabling persistence, file_mount sync can be made significantly faster.

.. code-block:: yaml

    name: storage-demo

    resources:
      cloud: aws
      instance_type: m5.2xlarge

    file_mounts:
      # This uses rsync to directly copy files from your machine to the remote
      # VM at /datasets. Since this uses rsync, the ~/datasets folder is
      # uploaded on each execution.
      /datasets: ~/datasets

      # This uses sky Storage to first create a S3 bucket named sky-dataset,
      # copies the contents of ~/datasets to the remote bucket and makes the
      # bucket persistent (i.e., the bucket is not deleted after the completion of
      # this sky task, and future invocations of this bucket will be much faster).
      # The bucket is mounted at /datasets-storage.
      /datasets-storage:
        name: sky-dataset
        source: ~/datasets
        force_stores: [s3] # Could be [s3, gcs], [gcs] default: None
        persistent: True  # Defaults to True, can be set to false.

    run: |
      pwd
      ls -la /

Finally, you can also directly mount s3/gcs buckets in your remote VM by
providing the path to the s3/gcs bucket.

.. code-block:: yaml

    name: storage-demo

    resources:
      cloud: aws
      instance_type: m5.2xlarge

    file_mounts:
      # This re-uses a predefined bucket (sky-dataset, defined above) and
      # mounts it directly at /datasets-s3.
      /datasets-s3: s3://sky-dataset

    run: |
      pwd
      ls -la /

Alternate Usage - Declarative Storage API
------------------------------------------
.. warning:: The declarative storage YAML API has been deprecated. If you need to create Storage objects but not mount them, use the storage CLI once it is supported.

Some power users may want to only upload their files to an object store
without mounting it, while others may want to re-use pre-existing storage
objects. They can do so using the storage and storage_mount fields, which are
at 1:1 parity with the sky.Storage python API.

Here's an example using the declarative API.

.. code-block:: yaml

    name: storage-demo

    resources:
      cloud: aws
      instance_type: m5.2xlarge

    storage:
      - name: sky-dataset-decl
        source: ~/datasets
        #force_stores: [s3] # Could be [s3, gcs], [gcs] default: None
        persistent: True

    storage_mounts:
      - storage: sky-dataset-decl # Name of the storage defined above
        mount_path: /datasets-decl # Path to mount the storage at

    run: |
      pwd
      ls -la /


Storage YAML field reference:

::

    storage: List[sky.Storage]

    Fields:
      sky.Storage.name: str
        Identifier for the storage object, used as reference in storage_mount

      sky.Storage.source: str
        The source attribute specifies the local path that must be made available
        in the storage object. It can either be a local path, in which case data
        is uploaded to the cloud to an appropriate object store (s3 or gcs), or it
        can be a remote path (s3://, gs://), in which case it is mounted directly.

      sky.Storage.force_stores: List[str]
        If you wish to force sky.Storage to be backed by specific cloud object
        stores, you can specify them here. If the Storage object does not already
        exist there, it will be replicated onto those clouds.

      sky.Storage.persistent: str
        Whether the remote backing stores in the cloud should be deleted after
        execution of this task or not. Set to True to avoid uploading files again
        in subsequent runs (at the cost of storing your data in the cloud). If
        files change between runs, new files are synced to the bucket.


Storage Mounts YAML field reference:

::

    storage_mounts: List[sky.storage_mounts]

    Storage mounts specify where the storage objects defined above should be
    mounted when the task is run.

    Fields:
      sky.StorageMount.storage: str
        Name reference to the storage object being mounted

      sky.StorageMount.mount_path: str
        Path where the storage object is to be mounted
