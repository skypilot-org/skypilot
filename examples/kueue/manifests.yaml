                  preemption describes policies to preempt Workloads from this ClusterQueue
                  or the ClusterQueue's cohort.


                  Preemption can happen in two scenarios:


                  - When a Workload fits within the nominal quota of the ClusterQueue, but
                    the quota is currently borrowed by other ClusterQueues in the cohort.
                    Preempting Workloads in other ClusterQueues allows this ClusterQueue to
                    reclaim its nominal quota.

                                      Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment. If a variable
                                      cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced
                                      to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. "$$(VAR_NAME)" will
                                      produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)". Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless
                                      of whether the variable exists or not. Cannot be updated.

                                          PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an
                                          API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure,
                                          preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                          container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                          PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                          container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                          period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                          or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                          Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate gracefully upon probe failure.
                                          The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent
                                          a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal.

                                          If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this
                                          value overrides the value provided by the pod spec.
                                          Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via

                                      RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                      This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                      For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                      the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                      Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                      this init container will be continually restarted on
                                      exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                      containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                      will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                      is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                      container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                      for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                      container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                      init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                      completed.

                                          The default is DefaultProcMount which uses the container runtime defaults for
                                          readonly paths and masked paths.
                                          This requires the ProcMountType feature flag to be enabled.

                                          container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                          PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                          container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                          period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                          or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                Init containers are executed in order prior to containers being started. If any
                                init container fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled according
                                to its restartPolicy. The name for an init container or normal container must be
                                unique among all containers.
                                Init containers may not have Lifecycle actions, Readiness probes, Liveness probes, or Startup probes.
                                The resourceRequirements of an init container are taken into account during scheduling
                                by finding the highest request/limit for each resource type, and then using the max of
                                of that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init containers
                                in a similar fashion.
                                Init containers cannot currently be added or removed.

                                      RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                      This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                      For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                      the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                      Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                      this init container will be continually restarted on
                                      exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                      containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                      will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                      is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                      container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                      for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                      container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                      init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                      completed.

                                          ResourceClaimTemplateName is the name of a ResourceClaimTemplate
                                          object in the same namespace as this pod.


                                          The template will be used to create a new ResourceClaim, which will
                                          be bound to this pod. When this pod is deleted, the ResourceClaim
                                          will also be deleted. The pod name and resource name, along with a
                                          generated component, will be used to form a unique name for the

                                      MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                      When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                      between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                      The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                      or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                      For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                      labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                      In this case, the global minimum is 1.

                                      |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                      - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                      scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                      violate MaxSkew(1).
                                      - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                      When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence

                                      When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                      Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                      And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                      this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                      As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                      scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                      If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                      Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                      When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.


                                      For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                      labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                      | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                      |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                      The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                      In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                      because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                      it will violate MaxSkew.

                                          If omitted, the default is to mount by volume name.
                                          Examples: For volume /dev/sda1, you specify the partition as "1".
                                          Similarly, the volume partition for /dev/sda is "0" (or you can leave the property empty).

                                      ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                      The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                      and deleted when the pod is removed.


                                      Use this if:
                                      a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                      b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                         tracking are needed,
                                      c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                      d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                         a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                         information on the connection between this volume type
                                         and PersistentVolumeClaim).


                                      Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                      APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                      of an individual pod.


                                      Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                      be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                      more information.


                                      A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                      persistent volumes at the same time.
                                    properties:
                                      volumeClaimTemplate:

                                          Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                          The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                          owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                          pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                          `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                          entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                          is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


                                          An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                          will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                          volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                          the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                          meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                          owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                          this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                          manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                                  dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                                  volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                                  core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                                  When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                                  the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                                  provisioner.
                                                  This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                                  if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                                  compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                  both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                                  value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                                  When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                  dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                                  There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                  * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                    allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                                  * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                    preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                    specified.
                                                  * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                    in any namespaces.
                                                  (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                                  (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
