# Example showcasing how env vars can be used in the file_mounts section.

# You can set the default values for env vars in this 'envs' section.
# When launching, `sky launch --env ENV=val` will override the default.

# You can use env vars in
#   - the destination: source paths
#   - for bucket mounting
#     - the "name" (bucket name) and "source" (local dir/file to upload) fields.

# Both syntaxes work: ${MY_BUCKET} and $MY_BUCKET.
