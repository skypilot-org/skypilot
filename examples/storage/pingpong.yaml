# sharedfs-pingpong - a demo to illustrate SkyPilot Storage's mounting feature.
#
# This program implements coordination between processes using a shared file
# system they can access. Each process reads data from <process-id>.txt, prints
# it, and writes to <process-id + 1>.txt. This creates a synchronization between
# processes where process i continues only after process i-1 has written its
# output.
#
# Usage:
#   sky launch -c pingpong pingpong.yaml
