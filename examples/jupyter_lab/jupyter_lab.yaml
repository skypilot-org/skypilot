# Example: Launch Jupyter Lab and auto-expose its port to Internet.
#
# Usage:
#     $ sky launch -c jupyter-lab-example jupyter_lab.yaml
#     # Then look for the logs for some output like:
#     # Jupyter Server 2.7.0 is running at:
#     #     http://127.0.0.1:29324/lab?token=<token>
#     # Run
#     $ sky status jupyter-lab-example --endpoints
#     # to get the HEAD_IP of the cluster, replace the 127.0.0.1 with
#     # the HEAD_IP and open browser for the URL.
#     
#     # This is an alternative to port forwarding.
