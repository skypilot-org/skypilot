# Running SkyPilot Tasks in Temporal Workflows

This example demonstrates how to launch SkyPilot tasks and manage them in a Temporal workflow.

All activities, such as launching clusters, executing tasks, and tearing down clusters, are run on the same worker, eliminating the need for SkyPilot's state management across multiple workers.

## Defining the Tasks

We will define the following tasks to mock a training workflow:
1. **`data_preprocessing.yaml`**: Generates data and writes it to a bucket.
2. **`train.yaml`**: Trains a model using the data in the bucket.
3. **`eval.yaml`**: Evaluates the model and writes the evaluation results to the bucket.

These tasks are defined in the [mock_training_workflow](https://github.com/romilbhardwaj/mock_train_workflow) repository. The repository is cloned during the workflow to execute the tasks.

## Workflow Overview

We define a Temporal workflow consisting of the following steps:

1. **Clone the repository containing tasks** using `git`.
2. **Launch a SkyPilot cluster** to run the data preprocessing job.
3. **Terminate the cluster** after preprocessing.
4. **Launch another cluster** for training the model.
5. **Execute an evaluation task** on the same training cluster.
6. **Terminate the cluster** after evaluation.

### Temporal Activities

These steps are implemented as Temporal activities, which are functions that can be executed by the Temporal worker:

- **`run_sky_launch`**: Launches a SkyPilot cluster with a specified configuration.
- **`run_sky_down`**: Terminates the specified SkyPilot cluster.
- **`run_sky_exec`**: Executes a task on an existing SkyPilot cluster.
- **`run_git_clone`**: Clones a Git repository to a specified location.

### Single Worker Execution

In this workflow, all tasks are handled by the same Temporal worker. This simplifies the workflow, as SkyPilotâ€™s internal state does not need to be transferred between different workers, ensuring seamless orchestration.

This is achieved by registering all activities (`run_sky_launch`, `run_sky_down`, `run_sky_exec`)to the same worker and enqueueing them in the same task queue:

```python
async with Worker(
    client,
    task_queue='skypilot-task-queue',
    workflows=[SkyPilotWorkflow],
    activities=[run_sky_launch, run_sky_down, run_sky_exec, run_git_clone]
):
```

## Running the Workflow

1. If running temporal locally, start the Temporal server:
    ```bash
    temporal server start-dev
    ```

2. Launch the workflow:
    ```bash
    python skypilot_workflow.py
    ```

3. Monitor the workflow execution in the Temporal Web UI (typically http://localhost:8233).

4. When the workflow completes, all logs will be available in the Temporal Web UI.
