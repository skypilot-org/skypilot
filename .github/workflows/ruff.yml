# Ruff linting and formatting workflow
# This workflow runs ruff for both linting and format checking
#
# Migration note: This workflow is designed to eventually replace:
# - format.yml (yapf, black, isort)
# - pylint.yml
#
# Initially run as non-blocking (continue-on-error: true) alongside
# existing workflows. Once stable, remove the old workflows.
