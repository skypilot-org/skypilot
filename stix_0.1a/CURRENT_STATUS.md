# STIX Current Implementation Status

**Date**: November 1, 2025  
**Phase**: Phase 1, Week 1 - Restructure & Core Setup  
**Progress**: 15%  
**Status**: 🚨 BLOCKED - Disk Space Exhausted

---

## 🚨 Critical Blockers

### 1. Disk Space Exhausted (CRITICAL)
- **Issue**: Filesystem at 100% capacity (891G/938G used)
- **Impact**: Cannot compile workspace due to /tmp full during aws-lc-sys build
- **Required**: Free at least 50GB for compilation
- **Actions Taken**: 
  - Cleaned target/ directory (freed 607.7 MiB - insufficient)
- **Next Steps**:
  - Identify and remove large files/directories
  - Consider moving cache to larger partition
  - Clean Docker images/containers if present
  - Review and remove old build artifacts

### 2. Structure Mismatch
- **Issue**: Current structure has 13 crates, plan requires 18 specific crates
- **Current Crates**: core, cloud, cli, server, db, agent, ui, sdk, utils, sky, ghost, llm, git
- **Missing Crates** (per FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md):
  1. stix-optimizer
  2. stix-provision  
  3. stix-catalog
  4. stix-jobs
  5. stix-serve
  6. stix-storage
  7. stix-config
  8. stix-auth
  9. stix-metrics
- **Extra Crates** (not in plan):
  - ghost (Isolated execution caves)
  - llm (LLM management)
  - git (Self-hosted Git service)
- **Decision Needed**: 
  - Keep extra crates and add missing ones? (23 total)
  - Replace extra crates with planned ones? (18 total)
  - Merge functionality?

## ✅ Completed Tasks (Week 1)

1. ✅ Verified existing crate structure
2. ✅ Reviewed workspace Cargo.toml configuration  
3. ✅ Assessed workspace dependencies (properly configured)
4. ✅ Documented blockers and issues
5. ✅ Updated PROGRESS.md with current status
6. ✅ Cleaned build artifacts

## ⏳ Pending Tasks (Week 1)

### Before Compilation
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Resolve disk space issue
- [ ] Decide on crate structure approach
- [ ] Create missing crates (if keeping current approach)
- [ ] Update workspace members in Cargo.toml

### After Disk Space Resolved
- [ ] Test compilation: `cargo check --workspace`
- [ ] Test builds: `cargo build --workspace`
- [ ] Run tests: `cargo test --workspace`
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Verify all crates have proper documentation

## 📋 Week 1 Deliverables Status

| Deliverable | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Working Cargo workspace | ✅ Complete | Exists and configured |
| All 18 crates created | ⚠️ Partial | 13/18 exist, structure mismatch |
| Basic CI/CD running | ❌ Not Started | Blocked by compilation |
| Documentation structure | ✅ Complete | Excellent documentation |

## 📊 Crate Mapping Analysis

### Existing → Planned Mapping

| Current | Planned | Match | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|-------|
| core | stix-core | ✅ | Direct match |
| cloud | stix-clouds | ✅ | Direct match |
| cli | stix-cli | ✅ | Direct match |
| server | stix-server | ✅ | Direct match |
| db | stix-db | ✅ | Direct match |
| agent | stix-skylet | ✅ | Likely match (remote agent) |
| ui | stix-dashboard | ✅ | Likely match |
| sdk | stix-sdk | ✅ | Direct match |
| utils | stix-utils | ✅ | Direct match |
| sky | ??? | ❓ | Unknown purpose |
| ghost | ??? | ❓ | Extra (isolated execution) |
| llm | ??? | ❓ | Extra (LLM management) |
| git | ??? | ❓ | Extra (Git service) |
| N/A | stix-optimizer | ❌ | Missing |
| N/A | stix-backends | ❌ | Missing |
| N/A | stix-provision | ❌ | Missing |
| N/A | stix-catalog | ❌ | Missing |
| N/A | stix-jobs | ❌ | Missing |
| N/A | stix-serve | ❌ | Missing |
| N/A | stix-storage | ❌ | Missing |
| N/A | stix-config | ❌ | Missing |
| N/A | stix-auth | ❌ | Missing |
| N/A | stix-metrics | ❌ | Missing |

### Recommended Action

**Option 1: Keep Both (Additive Approach)**
- Keep all 13 existing crates
- Add 9 missing crates from plan
- Total: 22 crates
- Pros: No disruption, additional features
- Cons: More complex structure, some redundancy

**Option 2: Align to Plan (Replace Approach)**  
- Remove/archive: sky, ghost, llm, git
- Add missing 9 crates
- Rename agent → stix-skylet, ui → stix-dashboard
- Total: 18 crates (as planned)
- Pros: Follows plan exactly, cleaner
- Cons: Loses extra features

**Option 3: Hybrid Approach**
- Core 18 as per plan
- Move ghost/llm/git to separate workspace or examples
- Best of both worlds

## 🎯 Next Immediate Actions

1. **CRITICAL**: Free disk space (target: 100GB free)
   ```bash
   # Check what's using space
   du -sh /* 2>/dev/null | sort -h
   
   # Clean Docker if present
   docker system prune -a
   
   # Clean cargo cache
   cargo cache -a
   ```

2. **After disk space resolved**: Decide on structure approach (consult with team/user)

3. **Create missing crates** (example for optimizer):
   ```bash
   mkdir -p crates/stix-optimizer/src
   # Create Cargo.toml and src/lib.rs
   ```

4. **Test compilation** once resolved
