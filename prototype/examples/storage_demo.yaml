# Storage API Demo.
#
# This YAML demonstrates how the storage API can be used - either through
# file_mount shorthand or the declarative storage API.
#
# Usage:
#   sky launch -c demo storage_demo.yaml
#   sky down demo

name: storage-demo

resources:
  cloud: aws
  instance_type: m5.2xlarge

###############################################
#  Using sky storage #
###############################################
# Sky storage can be used in two ways. First is the shorthand, which builds on
# the file_mounts API (see using_file_mounts.yaml) and is easier to use. The
# second is the the declarative API which allows more flexibility for users.
# Both achieve the same goal, but are specified differently. It is recommended
# for most users to use Method 1 since it is easier to use.


###############################################
#  Method 1  - file_mounts shorthand #
###############################################
# By default, file_mounts use rsync to directly copy files from local to remote
# VM. However, you can optionally have them backed by sky Storage, which uploads
# the files to a cloud store (e.g. S3, GCS) and have them persist there. By
# enabling persistence, file_mount sync can be made significantly faster.
# Finally, you can also directly mount s3/gcs buckets in your remote VM.
# The file_mounts below demonstrate all three examples.

file_mounts:
  # This uses rsync to directly copy files from your machine to the remote VM at
  # /datasets.
  /datasets: ~/datasets

  # This uses sky Storage to first create a S3 bucket named sky-dataset,
  # copies the contents of ~/datasets to the remote bucket and makes the
  # bucket persistent (i.e., the bucket is not deleted after the completion of
  # this sky task, and future invocations of this bucket will be much faster).
  # The bucket is mounted at /datasets-storage.
  /datasets-storage:
    name: sky-dataset
    source: ~/datasets
    force_stores: [s3] # Could be [s3, gcs], [gcs] default: None
    persistent: True  # Defaults to True, can be set to false.

  # This re-uses a predefined bucket (sky-dataset, defined above) and mounts it
  # directly at datasets-s3.
  /datasets-s3: s3://sky-dataset


###############################################
#  Method 2  - Declarative Sky API #
###############################################
# Some power users may want to only upload their files to an object store
# without mounting it, while others may want to re-use pre-existing storage
# objects. They can do so using the storage and storage_mount fields, which are
# at 1:1 parity with the sky.Storage python API.

# storage: List[sky.Storage]
#
# Storage represents an abstract data store containing large data files
# required by the task. Compared to file_mounts, storage is faster and
# can persist across runs, requiring fewer uploads from your local machine.
# A storage object is used by "mounting" it to a task. On mounting, the data
# specified in the source becomes available at the destination mount_path.
#
# Behind the scenes, storage automatically uploads all data in the source
# to a backing object store in a particular cloud (S3/GCS/Azure Blob).
#
# Fields:
#   sky.Storage.name: str
#     Identifier for the storage object, used as reference in storage_mount
#
#   sky.Storage.source: str
#     The source attribute specifies the local path that must be made available
#     in the storage object. It can either be a local path, in which case data
#     is uploaded to the cloud to an appropriate object store (s3 or gcs), or it
#     can be a remote path (s3://, gs://), in which case it is mounted directly.
#
#   sky.Storage.force_stores: List[str]
#     If you wish to force sky.Storage to be backed by specific cloud object
#     stores, you can specify them here. If the Storage object does not already
#     exist there, it will be replicated onto those clouds.
#
#   sky.Storage.persistent: str
#     Whether the remote backing stores in the cloud should be deleted after
#     execution of this task or not. Set to True to avoid uploading files again
#     in subsequent runs (at the cost of storing your data in the cloud). If
#     files change between runs, new files are synced to the bucket.

storage:
  - name: sky-dataset-decl
    source: ~/datasets
    #force_stores: [s3] # Could be [s3, gcs], [gcs] default: None
    persistent: True

# storage_mounts: List[sky.storage_mounts]
#
# Storage mounts specify where the storage objects defined above should be
# mounted when the task is run.
storage_mounts:
  - storage: sky-dataset-decl # Name of the storage defined above
    mount_path: /datasets-decl # Path to mount the storage at
