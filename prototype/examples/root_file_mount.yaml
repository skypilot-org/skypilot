# Example: file_mounts destination paths that require root access
#
# Sky will use sudo to create destination paths and run 'chown' on them, so that
# the 'run' command (logged in as non-root) can still access them.
resources:
  cloud: aws

# <VM path> : <local path>
file_mounts:
  /setup.py: ./setup.py
  /sky: sky

run: |
  ls -l /setup.py
  ls -lH /sky
