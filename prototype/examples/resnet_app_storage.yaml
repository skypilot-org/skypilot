# storage: List[sky.Storage]
#
# Storage represents an abstract data store containing large data files
# required by the task. Compared to file_mounts, storage is faster and
# can persist across runs, requiring fewer uploads from your local machine.
# A storage object is used by "mounting" it to a task. On mounting, the data
# specified in the source becomes available at the destination mount_path.
#
# Behind the scenes, storage automatically uploads all data in the source
# to a backing object store in a particular cloud (S3/GCS/Azure Blob).
#
# Fields:
#   sky.Storage.name: str
#     Identifier for the storage object, used as reference in storage_mount
#
#   sky.Storage.source: str
#     The source attribute specifies the local path or existing remote storage
#     that must be made available in the storage object.
#
#     If it is a local path, the data is uploaded to the cloud to an
#     appropriate object store (s3 or gcs). This upload is a one-way
#     non-destructive sync, i.e. unmodified files which already exist on
#     the remote cloud store are not uploaded again, and any local
#     deletes are not replicated on the remote store.
#
#     If it is a remote path (s3://, gs://), it is mounted directly when the
#     task is run.
#
#   sky.Storage.force_stores: List[str]
#     If you wish to force sky.Storage to be backed by specific cloud object
#     stores, you can specify them here. If the Storage object does not already
#     exist there, it will be replicated onto those clouds.
#
#   sky.Storage.persistent: str
#     Whether the remote backing stores in the cloud should be deleted after
#     execution of this task or not. Set to True to avoid uploading files again
#     in subsequent runs (at the cost of storing your data in the cloud).

    persistent: True

# storage_mounts: List[sky.storage_mounts]
#
# Storage mounts specify where the storage objects defined above should be
# mounted when the task is run.
#
# Fields:
#   sky.storage_mounts.storage: str
#     Name of the storage object to be mounted
#
#   sky.storage_mounts.mount_path: str
#     Path to mount the storage at. Do not include trailing slashes!
