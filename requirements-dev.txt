# For grpcio/protobuf code generation
# We arrived at 1.63.0 through the following:
# 1. pip install -e ".[all]"
# 2. pip show protobuf -> 5.29.5, so let's use 5.x as a baseline.
# 3. 1.63.0 is the oldest version of grpc that supports protobuf >= 5.x.y.
# TODO(kevin): Have this value be maintained by the CI pipeline,
# to make sure it's always up to date.

# Pin to avoid a runtime break between pydantic>=2.12 (which requires
# pydantic-core 2.41.x) and typing_extensions 4.13.x. In 2.41.x,
# pydantic-core does `from typing_extensions import Sentinel`, but 4.13.x no
# longer exports the public `Sentinel` symbol, causing ImportError. Keeping
# pydantic<2.12 avoids pulling pydantic-core 2.41.x. Revisit once upstream
# resolves the import or we align versions accordingly.
pydantic<2.12
